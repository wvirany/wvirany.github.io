      <description>Despite their overwhelming success in modern machine learning, deep neural networks remain poorly understood from a theoretical perspective. Classical statistical wisdom dictates that overparameterized models (i.e., models with more degrees of freedom than data samples) should overfit noisy data and thus generalize poorly. Yet, even in cases in which deep neural networks fit noisy training data almost perfectly, they still exhibit good generalizability. This contradiction has highlighted a serious gap between the theory and practice of deep learning, motivating the need for a more complete theoretical framework.</description>

      <title>Predicting Microbiome-Phenotype Associations in the Human Gut</title>

      <description>The human microbiome is a data rich ecosystem, which is generally known to have strong associations with host phenotypes (i.e., the set of observable characteristics of an organism). Yet, the extents of these relationships are not yet deeply understood. Until recently, the computing capabilities necessary to thoroughly analyze human microbiome data were severely lacking. However, due to novel advancements in sequencing technologies and data analysis techniques, there now exist a plethora of data, along with robust statistical tools, which can be leveraged to gain valuable insights into the impact of the human microbiome on overall health.</description>

      <title>Why the blog?</title>

      <description>I initially created an academic page to host a portfolio where I could show off my projects to potential employers. However, it quickly turned into a small passion for writing about the things I&amp;rsquo;m working on. Now, I enjoy maintaining this blog for several reasons:&#xA;First, I often find myself looking for resources which dumb down complicated research topics or offer helpful career advice. I have benefitted substantially from other academic blogs on the internet, so I maintain this blog in an attempt to repay that debt to others1.</description>
