      <description>Gaussian processes (GPs) have always been a particularly confounding topic for me in machine learning. In this blog, I attempt to present a spelled-out introduction to GPs, building up from a simple linear model. I provide both the underlying mathematics as well as a Python implementation. For the sake of clarity, I omit certain practical considerations regarding numerical stability, computational complexity, etc., which can all be found in standard treatments of GPs.</description>

      <description>Despite its ubiquity, I have frequently found myself in a state somewhere between discomfort and panic each time I am faced with the task of manipulating the Gaussian distribution, particularly in multiple dimensions. So, I&amp;rsquo;ve taken the opportunity to work through some detailed derivations involving the Gaussian.&#xA;In this blog, I focus on the multivariate Gaussian distribution, beginning by reasoning about its shape and properties in high dimensions. Then, I derive some useful formulas such as conditioning, marginalization, and certain transformations.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Neural Network Gaussian Process</title>

      <description>Despite their overwhelming success in modern machine learning, deep neural networks remain poorly understood from a theoretical perspective. Classical statistical wisdom dictates that overparameterized models (i.e., models with more degrees of freedom than data samples) should overfit noisy data and thus generalize poorly. Yet, even in cases in which deep neural networks fit noisy training data almost perfectly, they still exhibit good generalizability. This contradiction has highlighted a serious gap between the theory and practice of deep learning, motivating the need for a more complete theoretical framework.</description>

      <title>Predicting Microbiome-Phenotype Associations in the Human Gut</title>

      <description>The human microbiome is a data rich ecosystem, which is generally known to have strong associations with host phenotypes (i.e., the set of observable characteristics of an organism). Yet, the extents of these relationships are not yet deeply understood. Until recently, the computing capabilities necessary to thoroughly analyze human microbiome data were severely lacking. However, due to novel advancements in sequencing technologies and data analysis techniques, there now exists a plethora of data, along with robust statistical tools, which can be leveraged to gain valuable insights into the impact of the human microbiome on overall health.</description>
