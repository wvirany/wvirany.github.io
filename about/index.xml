      <description>I recently graduated from the University of Colorado with a B.S. in applied mathematics as well as minors in computer science and physics.&#xD;Broadly speaking, I am interested in machine learning, statistics, and optimization, typically with applications to the life sciences.&#xD;Specifically, I am currently working on a project involving the validation of generative AI models used in molecular design for early drug discovery.&#xD;AI is poised to revolutionize the drug development industry and make the discovery of new therapeutics faster and more affordable.</description>
